I have compiled a comprehensive list of all applicable denial codes used in Medicare Part B billing, including Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARCs), Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARCs), and Group Codes, sourced directly from official and authoritative documentation such as the CMS Medicare Claims Processing Manual and the Washington Publishing Company (WPC) website.

This will be tailored for the needs of a medical billing company engaged in denial management, ensuring all necessary codes and definitions are included for accurate interpretation and resolution of denials.

# Medicare Part B Denial Codes (CARCs, RARCs, and Group Codes)

## Overview of Denial Codes in Medicare Part B  
When Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) processes a claim, any payment adjustments or denials are communicated using standard code sets on the remittance advice (RA). These codes explain why a claim or service was denied or paid differently than billed, and they guide billing staff on next steps for denial management. The key code sets used are:  

- **Claim Adjustment Group Codes** – two-letter codes indicating the general category/reason of an adjustment (who is financially responsible) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Adjustment%20Group%20Codes%20are%20internal,Initiated%20Reductions%20PR%20Patient%20Responsibility)).  
- **Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARCs)** – numeric or alphanumeric codes that provide the specific reason a claim or service line was denied or adjusted ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=60,A)) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=approval%20of%20this%20committee,reason%20codes%20apply%20equally%20to)).  
- **Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARCs)** – alphanumeric codes that offer supplemental information or explanation for a denial/adjustment (often used in conjunction with a CARC) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=Remittance%20Advice%20Remark%20Codes%20,does%20not%20add%20supplemental%20explanation)) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=for%20a%20specific%20adjustment%20but,claim%20to%20conduct%20the%20appeal)).  

These code sets are maintained by CMS and the ASC X12 committee and are updated **three times per year** (around March 1, July 1, and November 1) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=The%20remark%20code%20list%20is,WPC%20Website%20after%20each%20update)). Medicare and other payers use the latest approved codes; obsolete codes are retired and should not be used. The **Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)** publishes quarterly **Recurring Update Notifications** (Change Requests) to inform MACs of code additions, deletions, or revisions. The *complete, up-to-date lists* of CARCs and RARCs are published by the Washington Publishing Company (WPC)/X12 and are available on the X12 website ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=The%20remark%20code%20list%20is,WPC%20Website%20after%20each%20update)). In Medicare’s Claims Processing Manual (Chapter 22), CMS instructs that MACs must use valid group, reason, and remark codes on all electronic and paper remittance advices ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=the%20approval%20of%20this%20committee,in%20the%20reason%20codes%20apply)) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=The%20remark%20code%20list%20is,the%20WPC%20Website%20after%20each)). 

Below is a comprehensive list of **Group Codes, CARCs, and RARCs** relevant to Medicare Part B billing. The list includes each code’s identifier and official description, as well as important usage notes (for example, when a CARC must be used with a particular RARC or a specific group code). This information is essential for any medical billing company to effectively manage denials and adjustments for Medicare Part B claims.

## Adjustment Group Codes (Category Codes)  
**Adjustment Group Codes** are two-letter codes that define the broad category of an adjustment and who is responsible for the amount adjusted ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Adjustment%20Group%20Codes%20are%20internal,Initiated%20Reductions%20PR%20Patient%20Responsibility)). On Medicare Part B RAs, a group code always accompanies CARCs to indicate if the provider can bill the patient for the amount or if it’s a contractual/provider write-off. The valid group codes in Medicare Part B are as follows:

- **CO – Contractual Obligation:** Adjustment due to a contractual agreement or a regulatory requirement. These amounts are *not billable to the patient* (the provider must write them off) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=amount,be%20used%20when%20a%20contractual)) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=an%20adjustment,when%20no%20other%20group%20code)).  
- **PR – Patient Responsibility:** Adjustment for which the patient is liable. These are typically deductible, coinsurance, or non-covered amounts that *can be billed to the patient* ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20OA%20,when%20no%20other%20group%20code)).  
- **OA – Other Adjustment:** Miscellaneous or unclassified adjustments. Used when no other group code applies. (OA is often used for denials where the patient is not responsible, but it isn’t a contractual write-off either) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=an%20adjustment,when%20no%20other%20group%20code)).  
- **PI – Payer Initiated Reduction:** Reductions initiated by the payer for reasons other than contractual obligations or patient liability (e.g. discretionary reductions). *(Note: Medicare generally avoids using PI on RAs; most Medicare adjustments fall under CO, PR, or OA. PI is more common with commercial payers.)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=characters,Initiated%20Reductions%20PR%20Patient%20Responsibility)).  
- **CR – Corrections and Reversals:** Used in some  legacy contexts for claim reversals. **Not used in HIPAA-standard transactions for version 005010 or above** ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=characters,Initiated%20Reductions%20PR%20Patient%20Responsibility)) (Medicare does not use CR in 5010+ transactions).  

## Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARCs)  
**Claim Adjustment Reason Codes (CARCs)** are standardized 3-digit (or alphanumeric) codes that explain the *specific reason* for a payment adjustment (denial, reduction, or increase). Only one CARC is used per adjustment line on the RA, but multiple CARCs can appear if there are multiple adjustments. CARCs are maintained by the Claim Adjustment Status and Reason Code Maintenance Committee and are generic codes used by all U.S. health plans, not just Medicare ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=the%20approval%20of%20this%20committee,in%20the%20reason%20codes%20apply)). However, not all CARCs apply to Medicare – the Medicare manual notes that some codes in the list may not be used by Medicare if not relevant ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=the%20approval%20of%20this%20committee,in%20the%20reason%20codes%20apply)). Medicare will only use currently valid codes and may ignore deprecated ones ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=not%20apply%20to%20Medicare,References%20to%20prescriptions%20also%20include)) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=Medicare,References%20to%20prescriptions%20also%20include)).

In denial management, CARCs are crucial as they tell you *why* a claim was denied or paid differently. Examples: Code 50 indicates “not deemed medically necessary” denial, 96 indicates “non-covered charges,” etc. Many CARCs include **usage notes** that must be followed. For instance: 

- Some CARCs *require* an accompanying RARC for further explanation. Example: **CARC 16 – “Claim/service lacks information or has submission/billing error(s)”** requires at least one remark code be sent with it ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=16%20Claim%2Fservice%20lacks%20information%20or,be%20comprised%20of%20either%20the)). Similarly, CARC 96 (“Non-covered charges”) and others have a note: “At least one Remark Code must be provided” ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=95%20Plan%20procedures%20not%20followed,if%20present)). These additional remark codes provide the missing information detail (e.g. which information is lacking or why charges aren’t covered).  
- Some CARCs are allowed only with specific Group Codes or in specific scenarios. For example, **CARC 18 – “Duplicate claim/service”** is used only with Group Code OA (Other Adjustment) for Medicare, except in certain Worker’s Comp situations where CO is required by state law ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,Last%20Modified%3A%2009%2F30%2F2007)). **CARC 23 – “Payment adjusted due to impact of prior payer(s) adjudication”** must be used with Group Code OA ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,deductible%20has%20not%20been%20met)). **CARC 45 – “Charge exceeds fee schedule/maximum allowable”** is used with Group Code CO or PR depending on whether the excess charge is provider write-off or patient’s liability ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=44%20Prompt,are%29%20not%20covered)). Such rules ensure consistency in how adjustments are categorized.

Below is an **extensive list of CARC codes** with their official descriptions and pertinent notes. This list is current as of the latest update (through March 2025) and reflects the codes a Part B biller would encounter on Medicare remittances. (Source of definitions: ASC X12 official CARC code list ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=306%20Type%20of%20bill%20is,Medicare%20Drug%20Price%20Negotiation%20Program)) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=A1%20Claim%2FService%20denied,another%20appropriate%20specific%20adjustment%20code)).)

| **14** | The date of birth follows the date of service.                             | – (DOB after DOS, likely data error)                                    |
| **15** | The authorization number is missing, invalid, or does not apply to the billed services or provider. | *(Deactivated 5/1/2018)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=15%20The%20authorization%20number%20is,if%20present)) – use other code (e.g. 197) for missing auth. |

([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=16%20Claim%2Fservice%20lacks%20information%20or,be%20comprised%20of%20either%20the)) | This is a *generic denial for incomplete/incorrect claim info*. A accompanying remark code will identify what is missing (e.g. missing claim form data, required attachment, etc). |
| **17** | Requested information was not provided or was insufficient/incomplete. *(Code 17 was deactivated in 2009)*. | Was used for missing info; now consolidated into other codes (e.g. 16). |
| **18** | **Exact duplicate claim/service.**                                         | Use only with Group Code **OA** (Other Adjustment) – except if state law for Workers’ Comp requires CO ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,Last%20Modified%3A%2009%2F30%2F2007)). Indicates the claim is an exact duplicate of one already processed. |
| **19** | This is a work-related injury/illness and thus the liability of the Worker’s Compensation carrier. | Claim denied to Medicare because Workers’ Comp is primary payer. |
| **20** | This injury/illness is covered by the liability carrier.                    | Denied to Medicare – a liability insurer is responsible.            |
| **21** | This injury/illness is the liability of the no-fault carrier.               | Denied – a no-fault (auto) insurer is responsible.                |
| **22** | This care may be covered by another payer per coordination of benefits.     | Possible COB – Medicare not primary for this service.            |
| **23** | **The impact of prior payer(s) adjudication including payments and/or adjustments.** | Use only with Group Code **OA** ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,deductible%20has%20not%20been%20met)). Indicates Medicare secondary payment was adjusted due to prior payer’s processing (COB reduction). |
| **24** | **Charges are covered under a capitation agreement/managed care plan.**    | The service is capitated/ prepaid by another plan (e.g. Medicare Advantage or HMO), so no payment by Medicare. |
| **25** | Payment denied. Your Stop Loss deductible has not been met.                | – (Used in contexts like commercial/stop-loss insurance; not typical for Medicare Part B). |
| **26** | Expenses incurred prior to coverage.                                       | Service date before the patient’s Medicare (or insurance) effective date. |
| **27** | Expenses incurred after coverage terminated.                               | Service date after coverage termination.                      |
| **28** | **Coverage not in effect at time of service.** *(Deactivated – combined into codes 26 & 27)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=28%20Coverage%20not%20in%20effect,not%20met%20the%20required%20eligibility)). | – |
| **29** | **The time limit for filing has expired.**                                | Denial because the claim was not filed within timely filing deadlines. |
| **30** | Payment adjusted because patient has not met required eligibility, spend down, waiting, or residency requirements. *(Deactivated 2006)* | – (No longer used by Medicare; more specific codes now.) |
| **31** | Patient cannot be identified as our insured.                               | The patient’s ID or contract number was not found (patient not enrolled on that date). |
| **32** | Our records indicate the patient is not an eligible dependent.             | Patient isn’t covered as a dependent (perhaps used in MSP or COB cases). |
| **33** | Insured has no dependent coverage.                                         | – (No coverage for dependents under that policy).         |
| **34** | Insured has no coverage for newborns.                                      | – (No newborn coverage on policy).                       |
| **35** | Lifetime benefit maximum has been reached.                                 | The patient’s lifetime benefit limit for this service/condition has been exhausted ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=35%20Lifetime%20benefit%20maximum%20has,network%2Fprimary%20care%29%20providers)). (Common in commercial plans; not applicable to traditional Medicare which doesn’t have lifetime max for Part B, except certain caps). |
| **36** | Balance does not exceed co-payment amount.                                 | The amount remaining is too small – within the patient’s copay, so no additional payment. |
| **37** | Balance does not exceed deductible.                                        | Remaining amount is within patient’s deductible (no payment from Medicare). |
| **38** | Services not provided or authorized by designated (network or primary care) providers. *(Deactivated – replaced by CARC 242 & 243)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=38%20Services%20not%20provided%20or,if%20present)) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=242%20Services%20not%20provided%20by,for%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20only)). | – (Network authorization denial; now use code 242/243). |
| **39** | Services denied at the time authorization/pre-certification was requested. | The service was denied by payer during prior authorization request – therefore not payable. |
| **40** | Charges do not meet qualifications for emergent/urgent care.               | The claim was billed as emergency or urgent care, but criteria for emergency coverage weren’t met ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=39%20Services%20denied%20at%20the,%28Use%20CARC%2045)). |
| **41** | Discount agreed to in Preferred Provider contract. *(Deactivated 2003)*    | Use code 45 instead for fee schedule reductions ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=41%20Discount%20agreed%20to%20in,schedule%2Fmaximum%20allowable%20or%20contracted%2Flegislated%20fee)). |
| **42** | Charges exceed our fee schedule or maximum allowable amount. *(Deactivated 2007 – instructs to use CARC 45)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=42%20Charges%20exceed%20our%20fee,not%20duplicate%20provider%20adjustment%20amounts)). | – |
| **43** | Gramm-Rudman reduction.                                                    | A reduction due to federal budget sequestration or similar legislative mandate. (Medicare uses this concept for sequestration: typically CARC 253 is used for the 2% sequestration adjustment ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=253%20Sequestration%20,only%20with%20Group%20Code%20OA)).) |
| **44** | Prompt-pay discount.                                                      | A payment reduction applied because the bill was paid promptly (often not applicable to Medicare Part B). |
| **45** | **Charge exceeds fee schedule/maximum allowable or contracted/legislated fee arrangement.** **Usage:** This adjustment amount cannot equal the total charge; and must not duplicate other reductions from prior payers. *(Use only with Group Code PR **or** CO, depending on liability.)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=44%20Prompt,are%29%20not%20covered)) | This is the standard code for **provider write-off of the amount above the allowable**. Medicare uses CO 45 for the difference between the billed charge and the Medicare allowable (when the provider is contracted/accepts assignment) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=44%20Prompt,are%29%20not%20covered)). If the patient is liable for an excess charge (e.g., non-participating provider not accepting assignment, limiting charge), PR 45 could be used. |
| **46** | This (these) service(s) is/are not covered. *(Deactivated – use code 96 instead)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=46%20This%20,a%20routine%2Fpreventive%20exam%20or%20a)). | – |
| **47** | This (these) diagnosis(es) is/are not covered, missing, or invalid.        | (Deactivated 2006) – Use code 167 for diagnosis not covered.      |
| **48** | This (these) procedure(s) is/are not covered. *(Deactivated – use code 96)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20Use%20code%2096,loop)). | – |
| **49** | This is a non-covered service because it is a routine/preventive exam or a diagnostic/screening procedure done in conjunction with a routine/preventive exam. **Usage:** Refer to the 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. | Medicare uses this for services excluded as routine or preventive (when not covered by policy). (For Medicare, many preventive services are now covered by law; this code might appear if something truly non-covered was billed as preventive.) |
| **50** | These are non-covered services because this is not deemed a “medical necessity” by the payer. **Usage:** Refer to the 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=49%20This%20is%20a%20non,if%20present)) | **Medical necessity denial.** Medicare uses CO 50 to indicate that the service was not reasonable and necessary under Medicare rules. Often accompanied by a remark code (e.g. NCD or LCD denial explanation). If the provider had the patient sign an ABN and it’s valid, Medicare would still use PR 50 (patient liable); if no ABN, CO 50 (provider liable). |
| **51** | These are non-covered services because this is a pre-existing condition. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,if%20present)) | (Not applicable to Medicare – Medicare does not exclude pre-existing conditions. This code is for other insurers that have such exclusions.) |
| **52** | The referring/prescribing/rendering provider is not eligible to refer/order/perform the service billed. | Medicare denial when the referring or rendering provider is not enrolled or not of a type that is allowed for that service ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,loop%202110%20Service%20Payment)). (E.g., ordering physician not found or not a Medicare provider). |
| **53** | Services by an immediate relative or member of the same household are not covered. | Medicare exclusion for services provided by immediate family (anti-kickback/self-referral rules for certain services). |
| **54** | Multiple physicians/assistants are not covered in this case. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,deemed%20experimental%2Finvestigational%20by%20the%20payer)) | Indicates only one physician’s service is covered (perhaps for assistant surgeon denial if multiple assistants billed, etc.). |
| **55** | Procedure/treatment/drug is deemed experimental/investigational by the payer. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=54%20Multiple%20physicians%2Fassistants%20are%20not,to%20be%20effective%27%20by%20the)) | Medicare denial for **investigational or experimental** services (not covered by Medicare). Often appears as CO 55 with an NCD or policy reference remark. |
| **56** | Procedure/treatment has not been deemed “proven to be effective” by the payer. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present.

| **57** | Payment denied/reduced because the payer deems the information submitted does not support this level of service, this many services, this length of service, **etc.** | (Deactivated 7/2007) – This was a general code split into 150–154. Now more specific codes 150–154 are used for these situations ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=57%20Payment%20denied%2Freduced%20because%20the,if%20present)) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2010%2F31%2F2002%20150%20Payer%20deems,loop)). |

([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20Split%20into%20codes%20150%2C,if%20present)) | Medicare denial if procedure is not covered in the setting billed (e.g., a service only covered inpatient was done outpatient, etc.). |
| **59** | Processed based on multiple or concurrent procedure rules. (For example, multiple surgery or diagnostic imaging rules, concurrent anesthesia.) **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,to%20or%20after%20inpatient%20services)) | Indicates an adjustment due to **multiple-procedure payment reduction** rules. Medicare uses CO 59 for multiple surgery reductions, imaging bundling, etc., where secondary procedures are paid at reduced rates. |
| **60** | Charges for outpatient services are not covered when performed within a period of time prior to or after inpatient services. | Medicare inpatient bundling rule – certain pre- or post-admission services are bundled into the inpatient payment (e.g. within 3-day window prior to admission for Part A). Denial code CO 60 appears on the Part B claim for services within that window. |
| **61** | **Adjusted for failure to obtain second surgical opinion.**               | Historically used if a plan required a second opinion for surgery and it wasn’t obtained (Medicare no longer has such a requirement; this is an old code). |
| **62** | Payment denied/reduced for absence of, or exceeding, pre-certification/authorization. | (Deactivated 4/2007) – Use 197 or 198 instead for no auth or exceeded auth ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=197%20Precertification%2Fauthorization%2Fnotification%2Fpre,this%20claim%2Fservice%20through%20%27set%20aside)). |
| **63** | Correction to a prior claim.                                              | (Deactivated 10/2003) – no longer used; replaced by specific codes for adjustments/reversals. |
| **64** | Denial reversed per Medical Review.                                      | (Deactivated 10/2003) – indicates a previous denial was overturned on appeal or review. |
| **65** | Procedure code was incorrect. This payment reflects the correct code.     | (Deactivated 10/2003) – now would use a combination of a denial for incorrect code and perhaps reprocessing with correct code). |
| **66** | Blood deductible.                                                         | Medicare Part B blood deductible (the first 3 pints of blood are unpaid). Appears as CO 66 for the amount of blood deductible applied. |

| **85** | Patient interest adjustment. **Notes:** Use only with Group Code PR if interest is patient’s responsibility ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=85%20Patient%20Interest%20Adjustment%20,Stop%3A%2001%2F01%2F2012)). | Used when patient owes interest on a delayed refund/overpayment. (Medicare rarely, if ever, bills patients interest – usually interest adjustments on Medicare RA are payer to provider). |
| **86** | Statutory adjustment. *(Deactivated – duplicative of code 45)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20Only%20use%20when%20the,against%20receivable%20created%20in%20prior)). | – |
| **87** | Transfer amount. *(Deactivated 2012)*                                    | Used for inpatient claim transfers between hospitals (not a Part B scenario). |
| **88** | Adjustment amount represents collection against receivable created in prior overpayment. | Indicates recoupment – a payment was withheld to repay a prior overpayment ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,Last%20Modified%3A%2007%2F01%2F2017)). Medicare shows recoupments as negative adjustments often with code 88 (OA 88 for recovered amount). |
| **89** | Professional fees removed from charges.                                 | Used when separating professional component from a charge. (E.g., if a facility billed a global charge but only technical component is payable by one entity, the professional fee portion is deducted.) |
| **90** | Ingredient cost adjustment. **Usage:** To be used for **pharmaceuticals** only ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=89%20Professional%20fees%20removed%20from,Stop%3A%2010%2F16%2F2003)). | Adjusts the drug ingredient cost (perhaps for 340B pricing or other reasons). Medicare Part B could use this for drugs if applicable (e.g., ASP adjustments). |
| **91** | Dispensing fee adjustment.                                              | Adjusts the dispensing fee for a drug ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=91%20Dispensing%20fee%20adjustment,Stop%3A%2010%2F16%2F2003)) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=89%20Professional%20fees%20removed%20from,Stop%3A%2010%2F16%2F2003)). (E.g., Medicare Part B drugs usually don’t have a dispensing fee except certain drugs; Part D uses this more). |
| **92** | Claim Paid in full. *(Deactivated 2003)*                                 | – (No payment adjustments – rarely used in modern transactions) |
| **93** | No Claim level adjustments. *(Deactivated 2003)*                        | – (Claim-level CAS segment not used – informational in old versions) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=92%20Claim%20Paid%20in%20full,Last%20Modified%3A%2009%2F30%2F2007)). |
| **94** | Processed in excess of charges.                                         | Payment exceeds charges (e.g., negative balance or interest paid). For Medicare, this could appear if interest was paid on an underpayment (so total paid > charges). |
| **95** | Plan procedures not followed.                                           | Denial for not following plan’s procedures (perhaps an HMO/private plan code; Medicare typically uses other codes for failure to follow procedures). |
| **96** | **Non-covered charge(s).** **At least one Remark Code must be provided** (may be an NCPDP Reject Code or RARC that is not an ALERT.) **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF) if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=95%20Plan%20procedures%20not%20followed,if%20present)) | This is a broad code indicating the service or charge is **not covered** by Medicare. A remark code will usually give the specific reason (e.g., statutory exclusion like hearing aids, cosmetic surgery, etc.). Medicare uses CO 96 for non-covered services (patient cannot be billed if it’s statutorily excluded; if patient could be liable, often PR 96 with an ABN is used). |
| **97** | The benefit for this service is included in the payment/allowance for another service/procedure that has already been adjudicated. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,physician%20service)) | This is a *bundling denial.* It means that this service is not paid separately because it is considered part of another service already paid. (Medicare example: denial of a procedure that is bundled into a more comprehensive code billed on same date). |
| **98** | The hospital must file the Medicare claim for this inpatient non-physician service. | Medicare requires certain services be billed by the hospital (Part A) rather than by an individual provider (Part B). This code appears on a Part B claim when such a service is denied because the hospital should include it in their bill (e.g., technical components during an inpatient stay) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,completion%20of%20services%20or%20claim)). |
| **99** | Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) Adjustment Amount. *(Deactivated 2003)*    | (Replaced by more specific MSP codes or reported via COB segments). |
| **100** | Payment made to patient/insured/responsible party.                      | Indicates the **payment was sent to the patient or policyholder** (rather than to the provider). Medicare uses this (PR 100) when the beneficiary was paid (e.g., patient paid by Medigap or another insurer, etc.) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,02%2F28%2F1999%20102%20Major%20Medical%20Adjustment)). In Medicare Part B, this can occur in indemnity situations or when forwarding to a secondary payer who paid the patient. |
| **101** | Predetermination: anticipated payment upon completion of services or claim adjudication. | Not generally used by Medicare (predetermination is a private insurance concept). |
| **102** | Major Medical Adjustment.                                              | For coordination with a “major medical” policy. Not used by Medicare. |
| **103** | Provider promotional discount (e.g., Senior citizen discount).         | Not a Medicare adjustment; applies if provider gave a discount. |
| **104** | Managed care withholding.                                              | A withhold amount under a managed care contract (not in Original Medicare). |
| **105** | Tax withholding.                                                      | Federal tax withholding from payment (Medicare will use this if required to withhold taxes from a provider payment). Appears as CO 105. |
| **106** | Patient payment option/election not in effect.                        | For example, patient did not have a private payment agreement in effect. Not typical for Medicare. |
| **107** | The related or qualifying claim/service was not identified on this claim. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. | A required linked claim wasn’t referenced. For example, a claim that requires referencing a primary claim (maybe for some secondary payment) didn’t have it. |
| **108** | Rent/purchase guidelines were not met. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. | Medicare denial if rental vs. purchase criteria not met (for DME). For example, CO 108 if a purchase was billed when rental was required first or vice versa. |
| **109** | Claim/service not covered by this payer/contractor. You must send the claim/service to the correct payer/contractor. | **Wrong payer** – e.g., claim sent to Medicare in error (not Medicare’s jurisdiction). Medicare uses CO 109 when a claim should be sent to a different insurer or to a different Medicare contractor (e.g., Part A vs Part B MAC, or a Medicare Advantage plan). ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=present.%20Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995)) |
| **110** | Billing date predates service date.                                   | Claim shows a billing/service date issue (perhaps a clerical error with dates). |
| **111** | Not covered unless the provider accepts assignment.                   | Medicare uses PR 111 if a service is only covered when the provider accepts assignment but they didn’t. (E.g., certain Medicare services require assignment). |
| **112** | Service not furnished directly to the patient and/or not documented.  | Denial if the service wasn’t a face-to-face service or lacks documentation. (Could be used if records show patient not present, etc.) |
| **113** | Service/procedure was provided outside the United States or as a result of war. *(Deactivated 2007 – replaced by 157, 158, 159)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=112%20Service%20not%20furnished%20directly,Codes%20157%2C%20158%20or%20159)) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=156%20Flexible%20spending%20account%20payments,that%20is%20a%20benefit%20exclusion)). | – |
| **114** | Procedure/product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). | Medicare denial for services involving drugs/devices not FDA-approved. (Not covered by Medicare). |
| **115** | Procedure postponed, canceled, or delayed.                            | No payment because procedure didn’t occur or was canceled. (Sometimes used if a claim was submitted for a service that was never provided). |
| **116** | The advance indemnification notice signed by the patient did not comply with requirements. | Medicare-specific denial when an **ABN (Advanced Beneficiary Notice)** was used but is invalid/unspecified. CO 116 means patient waiver isn’t valid, so provider is liable for the non-covered service ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=115%20Procedure%20postponed%2C%20canceled%2C%20or,118%20ESRD%20network%20support%20adjustment)). |
| **117** | Transportation is only covered to the closest facility that can provide the necessary care. | Medicare denial for ambulance: billed transport was to farther facility when nearer one could provide care, so only closest distance is covered (excess mileage denied). |
| **118** | ESRD network support adjustment.                                     | Used for End-Stage Renal Disease network levy (an amount withheld from dialysis claims to fund ESRD network; Medicare uses CO 118 to indicate that withhold). |
| **119** | Benefit maximum for this time period or occurrence has been reached. | The patient has exhausted coverage for this time period (e.g., frequency limits). Medicare e.g.: number of allowed visits for a preventive service in a period was exceeded. |
| **120** | Patient is covered by a managed care plan. *(Deactivated 2007 – use code 24)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=119%20Benefit%20maximum%20for%20this,Modified%3A%2009%2F30%2F2007%20122%20Psychiatric%20reduction)). | – |
| **121** | Indemnification adjustment – compensation for outstanding member responsibility. | Not used by Medicare. (Used by plans to credit member’s owed amounts in certain cases). |
| **122** | Psychiatric reduction.                                               | Inpatient psychiatric reduction (Medicare IPF reduction for psych) – not applicable to Part B. |
| **123** | Payer refund due to overpayment. *(Deactivated 2007)*                 | Use PLB codes for refunds; in 835 v5010+, overpayment refunds handled in a different segment. |
| **124** | Payer refund amount – not our patient. *(Deactivated 2007)*           | (Similar to 123; no longer used). |
| **125** | **Submission/billing error(s).** **At least one Remark Code must be provided** (may be an NCPDP Reject Code or non-ALERT RARC). ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20Refer%20to%20implementation%20guide,Major%20Medical)) | Another generic billing error denial (similar to 16). *Deactivated in 2013* – was used prior but now replaced by more specific codes. |
| **126** | Deductible – Major Medical. *(Deactivated 2008)* **Notes:** Use Group PR and CARC 1 instead ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,Start%3A%2002%2F28%2F1997)). | – |
| **127** | Coinsurance – Major Medical. *(Deactivated 2008)* **Notes:** Use Group PR and CARC 2 instead ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F01%2F1995%20,Start%3A%2002%2F28%2F1997)). | – |
| **128** | Newborn’s services are covered in the mother’s allowance.            | Denial on baby’s claim because services are paid under mother’s maternity global allowance (common in private plans; Medicare rarely deals with maternity/newborn global billing). |
| **129** | **Prior processing information appears incorrect.** **At least one Remark Code must be provided** (may be an NCPDP Reject Code or non-ALERT RARC) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20Use%20Group%20Code%20PR,Last%20Modified%3A%2001%2F30%2F2011)). | Used when a previous payer’s processing info is suspect or when adjusting an earlier decision – often seen in secondary billing if primary’s info is wrong. Must have a remark explaining what was wrong. |
| **130** | Claim submission fee.                                               | Deduction for claim filing fee (not applicable to Medicare; Medicare doesn’t charge filing fees). |
| **131** | Claim specific negotiated discount.                                | A specific negotiated discount was applied (likely not Medicare, but could apply if there was a demonstration or special arrangement). |
| **132** | Prearranged demonstration project adjustment.                      | Used for adjustments under a demo project. Medicare might use CO 132 for demo program payment adjustments. |
| **133** | The disposition of this service line is pending further review. **(Use only with Group Code OA.)** **Usage:** Use of this code requires a reversal and correction when the service line is finalized (use only in 835 Loop 2110 CAS or 837 Loop 2430). ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=132%20Prearranged%20demonstration%20project%20adjustment,Start%3A%2010%2F31%2F1998)) | This code indicates an **interim pending status** – the line is not finalized (perhaps in an interim payment situation). It’s essentially a placeholder and requires a corrected claim when finalized. Rare in Medicare Part B (more for some commercial processes). |
| **134** | Technical fees removed from charges.                              | Similar to code 89, separating technical vs professional charges. Could be used if a technical component is carved out. |
| **135** | Interim bills cannot be processed.                               | Denial because an interim or continuing claim was received where not allowed. (Medicare Part B typically doesn’t do interim billing; Part A does for hospital stays.) |
| **136** | Failure to follow prior payer’s coverage rules. *(Use only with Group Code OA)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=135%20Interim%20bills%20cannot%20be,Stop%3A%2005%2F01%2F2018)). | For COB: a previous payer denied because the provider didn’t follow that payer’s rules (so secondary payer also won’t cover). Medicare might use this if a primary payer’s denial was due to non-compliance, thus Medicare, as secondary, also won’t pay. |
| **137** | Regulatory surcharges, assessments, allowances or health-related taxes. | An adjustment for mandated surcharges or taxes (not common in Medicare Part B, but possibly in some states or plans). |
| **138** | Appeal procedures not followed or time limits not met. *(Deactivated 2018)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=137%20Regulatory%20Surcharges%2C%20Assessments%2C%20Allowances,Start%3A%2006%2F30%2F1999)). | Replaced by 285 and 286 (see below). |
| **139** | Contracted funding agreement – Subscriber is employed by the provider of services. **Use only with Group Code CO** ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=138%20Appeal%20procedures%20not%20followed,Stop%3A%2007%2F01%2F2012)). | Adjustment due to a **provider-employed subscriber** (could be a scenario where charges are reduced because patient works for provider – not applicable to Medicare). |
| **140** | Patient/Insured health identification number and name do not match. | Demographic mismatch denial – the patient’s name and ID (HICN/MBI) don’t correspond. Medicare CO 140 if the name/MBI on claim doesn’t match Medicare’s records. |
| **141** | Claim spans eligible and ineligible periods of coverage. *(Deactivated 2012)* | Replaced by CARCs 238, 239 for partial eligibility spans. |
| **142** | Monthly Medicaid patient liability amount.                          | Not a Medicare code (used in Medicaid crossover context). |
| **143** | Portion of payment deferred.                                       | A portion of payment is being deferred (held for later). Not typical in Medicare Part B. |
| **144** | Incentive adjustment, e.g. preferred product/service.              | An incentive payment or adjustment (e.g., choosing generics). Not common in Medicare Part B except maybe PQRS or MIPS adjustments (but those use other codes). |
| **145** | Premium payment withholding. *(Deactivated 2008)* **Notes:** Use CO 45 instead ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=144%20Incentive%20adjustment%2C%20e,Start%3A%2006%2F30%2F2002)). | – |
| **146** | Diagnosis was invalid for the date(s) of service reported.         | The diagnosis code billed was not valid on that date (perhaps ICD-9 vs ICD-10 timing or deleted code). Medicare CO 146 if an ICD code wasn’t in effect on DOS. |
| **147** | Provider contracted/negotiated rate expired or not on file.        | The contract rate used is not applicable (maybe contract lapsed). Not common in Medicare (Medicare sets rates, not negotiated per provider contract). |
| **148** | Information from another provider was not provided or was insufficient/incomplete. **At least one Remark Code must be provided** (either NCPDP Reject Code or non-ALERT RARC) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=148%20Information%20from%20another%20provider,reached%20for%20this%20service%2Fbenefit%20category)). | Denial because information needed from a third-party provider (e.g., referring physician documentation) was missing. A remark will detail what was missing. |
| **149** | Lifetime benefit maximum has been reached for this service/benefit category. | Similar to 35 but specific to a category of service. Medicare doesn’t have capped benefits for Part B except certain therapy soft caps (which now have exceptions process). This could appear in other insurances. |
| **150** | Payer deems the information submitted does not support this **level** of service. | This is a more specific version of code 57. E.g., downcoding a visit level: Medicare might deny an E/M code with CO 150 if documentation supports a lower level (though usually Medicare would pay at a lower level rather than deny – but if denied, remark might say it was downcoded). |
| **151** | Payment adjusted because the payer deems the information submitted does not support this **many/frequency** of services. | The number of units or frequency is not supported. (Medicare example: lab tests exceeded frequency limits without medical necessity, so units above limit denied as CO 151.) |
| **152** | Payer deems the information submitted does not support this **length** of service. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2010%2F31%2F2002%20150%20Payer%20deems,loop)) | For example, billed time for a procedure not supported by documentation. (Could be used if duration of a therapy or anesthesia is unsupported). |
| **153** | Payer deems the information submitted does not support this **dosage**. | Denial of a drug dosage as not supported (too high or not justified). Medicare might use CO 153 if a medication dosage is beyond policy without justification. |
| **154** | Payer deems the information submitted does not support this **day’s supply**. | Denial for days’ supply (typically a pharmacy concept – e.g., Part D or DME MAC for supplies). Not common on Part B physician RA. |
| **155** | Patient refused the service/procedure.                             | No payment because patient refused service. (Unusual on an RA; possibly informational.) |
| **156** | Flexible spending account payments. **Note:** Use code 187 instead (code 156 deactivated in 2009) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=156%20Flexible%20spending%20account%20payments,that%20is%20a%20benefit%20exclusion)). | – |
| **157** | Service/procedure was provided as a result of an **act of war**.    | Medicare exclusion – services resulting from war are not covered. CO 157 would be used instead of the older 113 code ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=156%20Flexible%20spending%20account%20payments,that%20is%20a%20benefit%20exclusion)). |
| **158** | Service/procedure was provided **outside of the United States**.   | Medicare generally does not cover services outside U.S. (with very limited exceptions). CO 158 is used for foreign-provided services denial (replaced old code 113) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=156%20Flexible%20spending%20account%20payments,that%20is%20a%20benefit%20exclusion)). |
| **159** | Service/procedure was provided as a result of **terrorism**.        | Another exclusion similar to war; Medicare treats terrorism injuries normally (so not sure if Medicare uses this code often). |
| **160** | Injury/illness was the result of an activity that is a benefit exclusion. | E.g., an injury from a excluded activity (like felony, or maybe sports for some policies). Medicare doesn’t exclude based on how injury occurred (aside from illegal acts possibly not covered by some supplements). |
| **161** | Provider performance bonus.                                         | Additional payment as a performance bonus (not a denial – an increase). Medicare had PQRS/MIPS adjustments (which could be bonuses or penalties, but those are often reported via CARC 144 or CO 237 for penalties). |
| **162** | State-mandated requirement for Property and Casualty (P&C), see Claim Payment Remarks Code for specific explanation. *(Deactivated 2014 – replaced by P1)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=161%20Provider%20performance%20bonus%20Start%3A,was%20not%20received%20in%20a)). | – |
| **163** | Attachment/other documentation referenced on the claim was not received. | Medicare uses CO 16 for missing documentation generally, but could use CO 163 in some cases to specifically indicate an expected attachment was not received at all ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2002%2F29%2F2004%20,Stop%3A%2005%2F01%2F2018)). (Requires sending a new claim with proper attachment.) |
| **164** | Attachment/other documentation referenced on the claim was not received in a timely fashion. | Similar to 163, but specifically not received on time. (If documentation was requested and not submitted timely, Medicare denial could be CO 164). |
| **165** | Referral absent or exceeded.                                        | (Deactivated 2018 – replaced by 288, 287 respectively for absent/exceeded) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=timely%20fashion.%20Start%3A%2006%2F30%2F2004%20,Usage%3A%20Refer%20to%20the%20835)). |
| **166** | These services were submitted after this payer’s responsibility for processing claims under this plan ended. | Claim submitted outside period of responsibility (maybe after employer changed insurers). Not common for Medicare. |
| **167** | This/these diagnosis(es) is/are not covered. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=167%20This%20,Last%20Modified%3A%2009%2F30%2F2007)) | Denial for non-covered diagnosis. Medicare uses CO 167 when the diagnosis billed is not covered for the service (e.g., does not meet National Coverage Determination criteria). A RARC usually gives the specific policy or states “not covered diagnosis.” |
| **168** | Service(s) have been considered under the patient’s medical plan. Benefits are not available under this dental plan. *(Deactivated 2018)* | Coordination note for dental vs medical. Not Medicare. |
| **169** | Alternate benefit has been provided.                                | Used when an alternate benefit is applied (common in dental – not Medicare Part B). |
| **170** | Payment is denied when performed/billed by this type of provider. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=169%20Alternate%20benefit%20has%20been,if%20present)) | The provider specialty or type is not eligible for this service. (Medicare example: chiropractor billing a service that only an MD can bill – CO 170). |
| **171** | Payment is denied when performed/billed by this type of provider in this type of facility. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=170%20Payment%20is%20denied%20when,a%20provider%20of%20this%20specialty)) | Combination of provider type and facility is not allowed. (E.g., a certain service must be done in specific setting by specific provider type). |
| **172** | Payment is adjusted when performed/billed by a provider of this specialty. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=171%20Payment%20is%20denied%20when,not%20prescribed%20by%20a%20physician)) | Similar to 170 but an adjustment (reduction) rather than full denial. Possibly used if a lower fee schedule applies to certain specialties. |
| **173** | Service/equipment was not prescribed by a physician.                 | Medicare denial if an order is required. E.g., certain DME or lab tests need a physician order – CO 173 if missing. |
| **174** | Service was not prescribed prior to delivery.                      | Service required prior approval/order before delivery (similar to 173). |
| **175** | Prescription is incomplete.                                        | For DME or drugs, the prescription/documentation is incomplete. |
| **176** | Prescription is not current.                                       | The order/prescription is expired or too old. |
| **177** | Patient has not met the required eligibility requirements.         | Perhaps specific program eligibility not met. Could be used if patient not eligible for a particular program’s benefits. |
| **178** | Patient has not met the required spend down requirements.          | (Medicaid concept, not Medicare). |
| **179** | Patient has not met the required waiting requirements. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=176%20Prescription%20is%20not%20current,if%20present)) | Some services require a waiting period (not typical in Medicare; more common in private insurance). |
| **180** | Patient has not met the required residency requirements.           | Not applicable to Medicare (Medicare doesn’t have residency periods aside from general eligibility). |
| **181** | Procedure code was invalid on the date of service.                 | Same as 146 – invalid code for DOS (likely duplicate purpose). Possibly used for HCPCS that were not yet effective. |
| **182** | Procedure modifier was invalid on the date of service.             | The modifier used wasn’t valid or didn’t exist for that date. (E.g., new modifier used before its effective date). |
| **183** | The referring provider is not eligible to refer the service billed. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=181%20Procedure%20code%20was%20invalid,not%20eligible%20to%20prescribe%2Forder%20the)) | If the referring doctor is not enrolled or not of a type allowed to make referrals for that service (similar to 170 but specifically for referring provider). Medicare uses CO 183 if, for example, the referring physician on a diagnostic test claim is not in PECOS or not eligible. |
| **184** | The prescribing/ordering provider is not eligible to prescribe/order the service billed. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=183%20The%20referring%20provider%20is,Last%20Modified%3A%2007%2F01%2F2017)) | If the ordering provider is not eligible (e.g., not enrolled or an excluded provider). Medicare Part B denial for an order from a provider not permitted (CO 184). |
| **185** | The rendering provider is not eligible to perform the service billed. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF), if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=,is%20not%20limited%20to%20Flexible)) | Rendering (performing) provider not eligible (perhaps lacked required certification or enrollment). Medicare uses CO 185 e.g. if a certain specialist is required but the rendering isn’t of that specialty. |
| **186** | Level of care change adjustment.                                   | Used when a claim is adjusted due to change in level of care (e.g., inpatient acute to skilled nursing). Not Part B. |
| **187** | Consumer Spending Account payments (includes FSA, HSA, HRA, etc.). | Not Medicare. This code might appear on crossover claims to indicate patient’s health savings account applied. |
| **188** | This product/procedure is only covered when used according to FDA recommendations. | Denial if used off-label not meeting coverage criteria. Medicare might use CO 188 if coverage is limited to FDA-approved indications and this was used otherwise. |
| **189** | “‘Not otherwise classified’ or ‘unlisted’ procedure code (CPT/HCPCS) was billed when there is a specific code for this procedure/service.” | Denial for using an unlisted code inappropriately. Medicare uses CO 189 if a provider billed an unlisted code but a valid specific code exists and should have been used. |
| **190** | Payment is included in the allowance for a Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) qualified stay. | Denial on Part B because the service is covered under the SNF’s consolidated billing during a covered SNF stay. Medicare uses CO 190 to indicate the service is part of SNF bundle. |
| **191** | Not a work related injury/illness and thus not the liability of the workers’ compensation carrier. *(Deactivated – replaced by P2)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=191%20Not%20a%20work%20related,07%2F01%2F2014%20Notes%3A%20Use%20code%20P2)). | – |
| **192** | Non standard adjustment code from paper remittance. **Usage:** This code is only used in electronic COB (837) when a paper RA code cannot be mapped to a standard CARC (applies to deductible, coinsurance, copay)** ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Segment%20,Last%20Modified%3A%2007%2F01%2F2017)). | This is a technical code for COB reporting – not generally seen by providers unless they are secondary payers processing an 837. |
| **193** | Original payment decision is being maintained. Upon review, it was determined that this claim was processed properly. | **Appeal upheld.** Medicare uses code N/A (remark) for this kind of statement, but in adjustment terms, CO 193 indicates that after a redetermination, the original decision stands (no change in payment). The claim was correct originally ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2010%2F31%2F2005%20,Last%20Modified%3A%2009%2F30%2F2007)). |
| **194** | Anesthesia performed by the operating physician, the assistant surgeon or the attending physician. | Medicare generally does not pay separate anesthesia to the surgeon or assistant who is performing the procedure (because it’s bundled). CO 194 denies separate anesthesia in those cases. |
| **195** | Refund issued to an erroneous priority payer for this claim/service. | If Medicare had to refund another payer (maybe an MSP situation correction). Uncommon to see on provider RA. |
| **196** | Claim/service denied based on prior payer’s coverage determination. *(Deactivated 2007 – use code 136)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2002%2F28%2F2006%20,treatment%20exceeded)). | – |
| **197** | **Precertification/authorization/notification/pre-treatment absent.**    | Service was provided without required prior authorization. Medicare uses CO 197 for no prior authorization when needed (though Medicare Part B itself doesn’t require pre-auth in most cases; could apply to Medicare Advantage or MSP scenarios) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=197%20Precertification%2Fauthorization%2Fnotification%2Fpre,this%20claim%2Fservice%20through%20%27set%20aside)). |
| **198** | **Precertification/notification/authorization/pre-treatment exceeded.** | Services exceeded the authorized amount or duration. (For instance, more visits than authorized.) Not typically used in Original Medicare Part B, but possible if a service has a set limit approved and provider exceeded it ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=197%20Precertification%2Fauthorization%2Fnotification%2Fpre,this%20claim%2Fservice%20through%20%27set%20aside)). |
| **199** | Revenue code and Procedure code do not match.                        | On an institutional claim, the HCPCS and revenue code are mismatched (not a Part B professional claim issue). |
| **200** | Expenses incurred during lapse in coverage.                         | COB denial: claim falls in a period patient had no coverage (perhaps used by Medicare if patient had a gap in Part B coverage). |
| **201** | **Patient is responsible for amount of this claim/service through a “set aside arrangement” or other agreement.** (Use only with Group Code PR) **At least one Remark Code must be provided** (NCPDP or non-ALERT RARC) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=200%20Expenses%20incurred%20during%20lapse,personal%20comfort%20or%20convenience%20services)) | Generally used for **Workers’ Compensation Medicare Set-Aside (WCMSA)** situations. Medicare uses PR 201 to indicate the patient’s set-aside funds must be used for this claim. **Note:** Medicare contractors are instructed *not* to use 201 for WC; they use P3 instead ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=200%20Expenses%20incurred%20during%20lapse,personal%20comfort%20or%20convenience%20services)). (So P3 is the equivalent for WC – see P3 under “Property & Casualty” codes below.) |
| **202** | Non-covered personal comfort or convenience services.              | Medicare denial for things like hospital television, telephone, or other comfort items – not covered by Medicare. CO 202 for those charges. |
| **203** | Discontinued or reduced service.                                   | A portion of the service was discontinued (e.g., surgery terminated early). Medicare might reduce payment accordingly; CO 203 could indicate no payment for the canceled portion. |
| **204** | This service/equipment/drug is not covered under the patient’s current benefit plan. | Generic not-covered denial (similar to 96). Possibly used if something is covered under Part D or a different part, but not under Part B. |
| **205** | Pharmacy discount card processing fee.                            | Not Medicare. (For discount card programs, not an insurance payment.) |
| **206** | National Provider Identifier (NPI) – missing.                     | Provider did not include their NPI. Medicare will deny with CO 206 if NPI is missing on claim (as NPI is required) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=205%20Pharmacy%20discount%20card%20processing,provider%20cannot%20collect%20this%20amount)). |
| **207** | National Provider Identifier – Invalid format.                    | The NPI submitted is not a valid 10-digit number or fails checksum. Denial until corrected. |
| **208** | National Provider Identifier – Not matched.                       | The NPI is not on file or not associated with the provider. Medicare CO 208 if NPI not found in their enrollment records. |
| **209** | Per regulatory or other agreement, the provider cannot collect this amount from the patient. However, this amount **may be billed to subsequent payer**. Refund to patient if collected. **(Use only with Group Code OA)** ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2007%2F09%2F2007%20,for%20rebate%2C%20are%20not%20covered)) | This is used when an amount is *not the patient’s liability by law*. For Medicare, OA 209 might appear for certain reductions that by law cannot be billed to the patient (e.g., MSP rules, or when patient was in a trial, etc.). The provider can attempt to get it from another payer if applicable. If the patient was mistakenly charged, must refund. |
| **210** | Payment adjusted because pre-cert/authorization not received in a timely fashion. | Late authorization. Similar to 197 but specifically that auth was eventually obtained but too late. Not typical in Medicare Part B. |
| **211** | National Drug Codes (NDC) not eligible for rebate are not covered. | Medicare Part B usually doesn’t require rebate info; this is more for Medicaid (Medicaid won’t pay for drugs not eligible for federal rebate). Possibly seen on crossover claims. |
| **212** | Administrative surcharges are not covered.                        | Extra admin fees (like handling fees) not covered by Medicare. |
| **213** | Non-compliance with physician self-referral prohibition (Stark law) or other payer policy. | Medicare denial if claim violates Stark law (physician referring to owned entity). CO 213 if a service is disallowed due to self-referral regulations. |
| **214** | Workers’ Compensation claim adjudicated as non-compensable. This payer not liable for claim or service. **Note:** If adjustment is at Claim Level, include policy # in REF; if Line Level, include policy in 2110 REF. **To be used for Workers’ Comp only** *(Deactivated 2014 – replaced by P4)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2011%2F05%2F2007%20213%20Non,at%20the%20Line%20Level%2C%20the)) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Identification%20Segment%20,07%2F01%2F2014%20Notes%3A%20Use%20code%20P4)). | – |
| **215** | Based on subrogation of a third party settlement.                 | Payment adjusted due to a liability settlement (third-party liability). Medicare may use OA 215 when it recoups payments because a liability insurer settled (Medicare’s rights of subrogation). |
| **216** | Based on the findings of a review organization or the payer’s findings. | A claim adjustment due to external review (e.g. a QIC or QIO or auditor decision). For example, a postpay audit determined an overpayment – CO 216 adjustment made ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=215%20Based%20on%20subrogation%20of,Last%20Modified%3A%2003%2F01%2F2025)). (Note: As of Mar 2025, wording updated slightly ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=446%2012%2F11%2F2024%201219%20and%20122,may%20be%20comprised%20of)).) |
| **217** | Based on payer’s reasonable and customary fees. No maximum allowable defined by legislated fee schedule. **(Property & Casualty only)** *(Deactivated 2014 – replaced by P5)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=216%20Based%20on%20the%20findings,for%20Property%20and%20Casualty%20only)). | – |
| **218** | Based on entitlement to benefits. **Note:** If Claim Level, include policy in 2100 REF; if Line Level, include in 2110 REF. **To be used for Workers’ Comp only** *(Deactivated 2014 – replaced by P6)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20Use%20code%20P5%20218,Stop%3A%2007%2F01%2F2014)). | – |
| **219** | Based on extent of injury. **Usage:** If Claim Level, include policy in 2100 REF; if Line Level, include in 2110 REF (jurisdictional regulations). | Used when WC/auto only partially cover an injury (extent of injury dispute). Not typical in Medicare unless coordinating with WC. |
| **220** | “The applicable fee schedule/fee database does not contain the billed code. Please resubmit with appropriate code(s) …” **(Property & Casualty only)** *(Deactivated 2014 – replaced by P7)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Segment%20,at%20the%20Claim%20Level%2C%20the)). | – |

| **222** | Exceeds the contracted maximum number of hours/days/units by this provider for this period. (This is not patient-specific.) **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF) if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20Use%20code%20P8%20222,new%20code%20can%20be%20created)) | Denial because the provider as an entity exceeded some contract volume limit (not something Medicare does – more for managed care networks or per diem hour limits). Not used in Medicare FFS. |
| **223** | Adjustment code for mandated federal, state or local law/regulation that is not covered by another code and is mandated before a new code can be created. | A catch-all for legally mandated adjustments that don’t have a specific code yet. Could be used temporarily until a new code is established. For example, when sequestration 2% cut was new, a generic code might have been used before CARC 253 was created. |
| **224** | Patient identification compromised by identity theft. Identity verification required for processing this and future claims. | Alerts that claims are on hold until patient’s identity is verified (potential fraud). Medicare might use this if there’s an alert on the beneficiary’s file for identity theft issues. |
| **225** | Penalty or Interest Payment by Payer (*plan-to-plan only*).           | Used in plan-to-plan encounters, not on provider RA. Not a Part B provider scenario. |
| **226** | Information requested from the **Billing/Rendering Provider** was not provided or was not provided timely or was insufficient. **At least one Remark Code must be provided** (NCPDP Reject Code or non-ALERT RARC) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=226%20Information%20requested%20from%20the,that%20is%20not%20an%20ALERT)). | Medicare denial when the **provider** didn’t submit requested info (e.g., medical records). Similar to 16 but specifically after an ADR (Additional Documentation Request). Must include a remark like MA01 (“patient appeal rights”) or N*** indicating what was missing. |
| **227** | Information requested from the **patient/insured/responsible party** was not provided or was insufficient/incomplete. **At least one Remark Code must be provided** (NCPDP Reject Code or non-ALERT RARC) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2009%2F21%2F2008%20,for%20their%20adjudication%20Start%3A%2009%2F21%2F2008)). | Denial when information was needed from the **patient** (or insured) and not received. For example, MSP questionnaire info not provided by patient. Medicare CO 227 might be used if a beneficiary fails to respond to development requests (with an appropriate remark code). |
| **228** | Denied for failure of this provider, another provider, or the subscriber to supply requested information to a previous payer for their adjudication. | Essentially, a previous payer (primary) couldn’t process due to lack of info from someone, so secondary (Medicare) won’t pay either. This coordinates with COB rules. |
| **229** | Partial charge amount not considered by Medicare due to the initial claim Type of Bill being 12X. **Usage:** This code can only be used in the 837 COB to convey info when secondary payer’s policy allows bypassing prior payer. **(Use only with Group Code PR)** ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=228%20Denied%20for%20failure%20of,Last%20Modified%3A%2007%2F01%2F2017)). | Niche scenario code for a specific COB use (home health no-pay bills perhaps). Rarely seen by providers; used in data interchange between payers. |
| **230** | No available or correlating CPT/HCPCS code to describe this service. **Note:** Used only by Property and Casualty. *(Deactivated 2014 – replaced by P9)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=229%20Partial%20charge%20amount%20not,Stop%3A%2007%2F01%2F2014)). | – |
| **231** | Mutually exclusive procedures cannot be done in the same day/setting. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF) if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F25%2F2009%20,patient%20care%20crosses%20multiple%20institutions)) | Denial for procedures that by policy are mutually exclusive when billed together. Medicare uses NCCI (Correct Coding Initiative) edits for this – typically CARC 236 for NCCI bundling, but 231 might be used in some cases for mutually exclusive procedure denial. |
| **232** | Institutional Transfer Amount. **Usage:** Applies to institutional claims only, explains DRG amount difference when patient care crosses multiple institutions. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Payment%20Information%20REF%29%2C%20if%20present,Start%3A%2001%2F24%2F2010)) | Not a Part B professional code (inpatient claim adjustment). |
| **233** | Services/charges related to the treatment of a **hospital-acquired condition** or **preventable medical error**. | Medicare will not pay additional costs due to certain hospital-acquired conditions. This code would indicate a reduction because the charges were associated with a preventable condition (for hospitals under Medicare’s HAC policy). Not used on Part B professional claims. |
| **234** | **This procedure is not paid separately.** **At least one Remark Code must be provided** (NCPDP Reject Code or non-ALERT RARC) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=233%20Services%2Fcharges%20related%20to%20the,that%20is%20not%20an%20ALERT)). | A very common bundling denial code for Medicare: **“not paid separately”** – the service is included in another service’s payment. (Similar to 97 but often used for lab panels, etc.) Always accompanied by a remark to clarify (e.g., “bundled with procedure X”). |
| **235** | Sales Tax.                                                           | If sales tax was included in charges, this code might represent adjustment of tax. (Medicare generally doesn’t pay sales tax, except maybe on DME in certain states, which is handled separately.) |
| **236** | This procedure or procedure/modifier combination is not compatible with another procedure/modifier combination provided on the same day per National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) or state regulation. | **NCCI bundling denial.** Medicare uses CO 236 for a code denied due to an NCCI edit (the code is bundled into another code due to mutually exclusive or comprehensive/component edit) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=235%20Sales%20Tax%20Start%3A%2006%2F06%2F2010,Reason%20Code%2C%20or%20Remittance%20Advice)). Essentially a more explicit bundling denial code. |
| **237** | **Legislated/Regulatory Penalty.** **At least one Remark Code must be provided** (NCPDP Reject Code or non-ALERT RARC) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2001%2F30%2F2011%20,Last%20Modified%3A%2007%2F01%2F2013)). | A reduction in payment due to a legislated penalty. Medicare example: PQRS or MIPS downward adjustments on claims were reported with CO 237 and a remark code. This requires a remark (e.g., N699 for “Payment adjusted based on PQRS”). |
| **238** | Claim spans eligible and ineligible periods of coverage; this is the reduction for the ineligible period. **(Use only with Group Code PR)** ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Start%3A%2006%2F05%2F2011%20238%20Claim%20spans,loop%202110%20Service%20Payment)). | Used when part of the claim’s date range was not covered. PR 238 indicates the portion the patient owes because they were not covered during that part of the claim. (Typically an institutional claim issue). |
| **239** | Claim spans eligible and ineligible periods of coverage. Re-bill separate claims. | Instructional denial: the claim had dates both covered and not covered; Medicare wants it split into separate claims. CO 239 would be used to deny the combined claim. |
| **240** | The diagnosis is inconsistent with the patient’s birth weight. **Usage:** Refer to 835 Healthcare Policy Identification Segment (loop 2110 REF) if present. ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=claims.%20Start%3A%2003%2F01%2F2012%20,provided%20by%20network%2Fprimary%20care%20providers)) | Applies to newborn claims (e.g., certain neonatal services require specific birth weight diagnoses). Not used on Part B professional claims. |
| **241** | Low Income Subsidy (LIS) co-payment amount.                        | Used in Part D (Medicare Prescription Drug) to indicate the amount of copay reduced by LIS. Not a Part B code on its own. |
| **242** | **Services not provided by network/primary care providers.**         | Replacement for code 38 (see code 38). Denial for going out of network or not having PCP referral ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=242%20Services%20not%20provided%20by,for%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20only)). Medicare FFS doesn’t use this (no networks), but Medicare Advantage might. |
| **243** | **Services not authorized by network/primary care providers.**       | Replacement for code 38 as well. Similar meaning – no required prior authorization by PCP/network ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=242%20Services%20not%20provided%20by,for%20Property%20%26%20Casualty%20only)). Not used in Original Medicare. |
| **244** | Payment reduced to zero due to litigation. Additional info will be sent after litigation concludes. **(P&C only)** *(Deactivated 2014 – replaced by P10)* ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20This%20code%20replaces%20deactivated,is%20for%20required%20reporting%20only)). | – |
| **245** | Provider performance program withhold.                              | A portion of payment withheld under a performance program. (Medicare ACOs or some programs might withhold a percentage – but usually these aren’t reflected on individual claim RAs for Part*(The CARC list above covers the most frequently used denial reason codes for Medicare Part B. Additional CARCs up through the 300-series and alphanumeric codes (e.g., A0–A8, B1–B23, and P1–P11 for property/casualty contexts) also exist. For example, CARC **253** denotes the 2% federal **sequestration** payment reduction ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=253%20Sequestration%20,patient%27s%20medical%20plan%20for%20further)) (which Medicare applies to most claims), and CARC **258** indicates the patient is **incarcerated** (services generally not payable by Medicare) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=258%20Claim%2Fservice%20not%20covered%20when,payment%20for%20Dental%2FVision%20service%20utilization)). Medicare will utilize these and other codes as appropriate. The official ASC X12 code list should be consulted for the full current set of CARCs and detailed definitions ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=the%20approval%20of%20this%20committee,in%20the%20reason%20codes%20apply)) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=The%20remark%20code%20list%20is,WPC%20Website%20after%20each%20update)).)*

## Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARCs)  
While CARCs convey the primary reason for an adjustment, **Remittance Advice Remark Codes (RARCs)** provide **additional explanation or context**. RARCs are alphabetic or alphanumeric codes that augment the denial message beyond the basic reason. Each RARC corresponds to a text remark that can give instructions, request information, or clarify denial reasons ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=Remittance%20Advice%20Remark%20Codes%20,does%20not%20add%20supplemental%20explanation)). There are two types of RARCs: 

- **Supplemental Remarks:** These are tied to a specific adjustment and **must be used with a CARC**, to further explain the denial. For example, if CARC 16 (“lack of information”) is used, a RARC will specify what information is missing (e.g., “Missing/invalid modifier” or “Documentation not submitted”). Many CARC definitions explicitly state “At least one Remark Code must be provided” to ensure a supplemental remark is sent ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=16%20Claim%2Fservice%20lacks%20information%20or,be%20comprised%20of%20either%20the)) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=95%20Plan%20procedures%20not%20followed,if%20present)). Supplemental RARCs usually have codes starting with letters like *N* or *M* (or two-letter combinations like *MA*), followed by a number (e.g., **N372** – “Missing/incomplete/invalid patient identifier”). These do **not** include the word “Alert” in their text.  
- **Informational “Alert” Remarks:** These RARCs are **informational only** and are not linked to a specific CARC adjustment ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=apply,fair%20to%20you%2C%20we%20require)). They often start with “**Alert:**” in the description. For example, **MA01 – “Alert: If you do not agree with what we approved... you may appeal our decision…”** is a standard Medicare remark advising providers/beneficiaries of appeal rights ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=for%20a%20specific%20adjustment%20but,claim%20to%20conduct%20the%20appeal)). Alerts may appear at the claim level (in the claim-level remark segments MIA/MOA) or at the line level, and they **do not require any CARC**. They are used to convey policy reminders, appeal information, forwarding notice to another insurer, etc., and are typically prefixed with “MA”, “MB”, or “N” codes in Medicare (e.g., **MA18 – “Alert: The claim information has also been forwarded to Medicaid”**, **N569 – “Alert: This procedure code requires prior authorization”**).

CMS maintains the RARC list and updates it tri-annually in coordination with X12 ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=The%20remark%20code%20list%20is,WPC%20Website%20after%20each%20update)). Like CARCs, new RARCs are added and others are retired regularly. Each RARC has an alphanumeric identifier. For example: **MA04** indicates Medicare needs information on the primary payer – *“Secondary payment cannot be considered without the identity of or payment information from the primary payer”* ([Remittance Advice Remark Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/remittance-advice-remark-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20Consider%20using%20MA02%20,not%20reported%20or%20was%20illegible)) (this remark would accompany CARC 22 when Medicare rejects a claim for missing other insurance info). Another example: **N382 – “Missing/incomplete/invalid patient identifier”** might accompany CARC 16 on a denial for no Medicare Beneficiary ID. 

On Medicare Part B remittances, some common RARCs include: 

- **MA** series (Medicare specific alerts/remarks): e.g., **MA01** and **MA02** (appeal rights notices) ([Remittance Advice Remark Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/remittance-advice-remark-codes#:~:text=MA01%20Alert%3A%20If%20you%20do,you%20must%20write%20to%20us)), **MA04** (missing primary insurer info) ([Remittance Advice Remark Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/remittance-advice-remark-codes#:~:text=Notes%3A%20Consider%20using%20MA02%20,not%20reported%20or%20was%20illegible)), **MA18** (claim forwarded to Medicaid), **MA130** (patient enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, claim not payable by Medicare FFS).  
- **N** series (national remarks): e.g., **N519** “Invalid combination of HCPCS modifiers”, **N290** “Missing required credentialing data”, **N428** “Not covered when performed in this location/facility type”, **N656** “Alert: This is a packaged service under the OPPS; separate payment is not made” (informational for hospital claims), etc.  
- **M** series: e.g., **M144** “Alert: Patient is a member of an HMO, cannot bill Medicare FFS”, **M124** “Missing/incomplete/invalid CLIA certification number”. (Codes starting with M (without a second letter) are generally non-alert remarks.)  
- **Others:** RARCs can also have two-letter prefixes like **CO**, **PI**, **PR** in some contexts, but those prefixes in remark codes are rare (note: not to be confused with group codes; RARCs are distinct). Most Medicare-specific remark codes carry the prefix **MA** or **N**, while **M**-only codes are often general usage.  

Each RARC’s official description and requirements are maintained on the X12/WPC website. Just as with CARCs, contractors are instructed to use the appropriate RARC that best explains the denial. If an adjustment is missing required detail, Medicare will return the claim for development or use generic remarks like MA130/MA61. Some remark codes are informational alerts that Medicare always includes (for instance, **MAford** series for appeals, or **NPAD** codes for deductible and coinsurance information on paper remits).

**Important:** In Medicare Part B denial management, **RARCs are crucial to understanding the precise denial reason and next steps**. Always review the remark codes on the RA, as they may indicate needed actions (such as “**MA39** – *Patient contacted via phone**” or “**N375** – *Missing/incomplete notes/operative report**”). Some CARC/RARC combinations are mandated by CMS for certain scenarios. For example, a denial for therapy cap exception will include a specific remark code, an MSP denial will include an MA** code explaining what info is needed, etc. Medicare publishes a **CARC/RARC crosswalk** for certain business scenarios (in quarterly update change requests) to ensure consistency in messaging ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Disapproved%20453%202%2F17%2F2025%20Please%20update,code%20n657%20Revision%20N657%20Pending)) ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=453%202%2F17%2F2025%20Please%20update%20CARC,code%20n657%20Revision%20N657%20Pending)).

### Reference and Download  
Medicare contractors and billing professionals should refer to **Chapter 22 of the Medicare Claims Processing Manual** for guidance on RA codes usage ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=60,A)) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=Remittance%20Advice%20Remark%20Codes%20,does%20not%20add%20supplemental%20explanation)). The **official up-to-date lists of CARCs and RARCs** (and their definitions and valid usage notes) are available through the Washington Publishing Company / ASC X12 website ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=The%20remark%20code%20list%20is,WPC%20Website%20after%20each%20update)). These code lists can be viewed or downloaded (X12 publishes the lists online, and updates them three times yearly in sync with CMS). It is advisable for denial management staff to keep the latest code lists on hand.

- **Claim Adjustment Group Codes:** Refer to the definitions in the X12 list ([Claim Adjustment Reason Codes | X12](https://x12.org/codes/claim-adjustment-reason-codes#:~:text=Adjustment%20Group%20Codes%20are%20internal,Initiated%20Reductions%20PR%20Patient%20Responsibility)) or the Medicare manual ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=amount,be%20used%20when%20a%20contractual)) ([](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/manuals/downloads/clm104c22pdf.pdf#:~:text=an%20adjustment,when%20no%20other%20group%20code)) (CO, PR, OA, PI as defined above).
