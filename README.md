# Template ADK Project

This repository contains a template project for developing AI agents using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). It serves as a starting point for creating sophisticated AI agents with flexibility and control.

## What's Included

- **ADK Framework Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation on how to use the Google ADK framework
- **ADK Python Library**: Included as a git submodule, providing the official Google ADK implementation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/nabbilkhan/Template-ADK-Project.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Explore the ADK documentation in the `ADK_Framework_Documentation` directory

## Documentation Structure

- **Getting Started**: Installation guides, quickstart tutorials
- **Core Concepts**: Understanding agents, tools, sessions, and memory
- **Tools**: Overview of different tool types (Function tools, Cloud tools, etc.)
- **Deployment**: Options for deploying your agents
- **Advanced Topics**: Callbacks, runtime configuration, model integration
- **Examples**: Sample agent implementations
- **Testing & Evaluation**: Approaches for testing and evaluating agents
- **Responsible AI**: Guidelines for building responsible AI agents

## Using the ADK

The ADK allows you to:

- Define agents directly in code for flexibility and versioning
