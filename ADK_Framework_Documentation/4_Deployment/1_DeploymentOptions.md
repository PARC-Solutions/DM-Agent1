# Deployment Options

Once you've built and tested your agent using ADK, the next step is to deploy it so it can be accessed, queried, and used in production or integrated with other applications. Deployment moves your agent from your local development machine to a scalable and reliable environment.

## Deployment Overview

Your ADK agent can be deployed to various environments based on your needs for production readiness or custom flexibility:

| Deployment Option | Description | Best For |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Local Development** | Run agents locally during development | Development, testing, prototyping |
| **Agent Engine in Vertex AI** | Google Cloud's fully managed auto-scaling agent service | Production, enterprise, managed service |
| **Cloud Run** | Container-based serverless deployment | Production, custom infrastructure |
| **Docker Container** | Custom container deployment to any environment | Flexibility, custom infrastructure |
| **Custom Infrastructure** | Custom integration into existing applications | Complex integration, special requirements |

## Local Development Deployment

During development, you can run your agents locally using the built-in ADK server:

```python
from google.adk.server import run_local_server
from your_agent_module import your_agent

# Run the agent locally
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_local_server(your_agent)
```

This starts a local development server (typically at http://localhost:8080) that provides:
- A web-based chat interface
- API endpoints for agent interaction
- Debugging tools

### Command Line Interface

You can also interact with your agent through the command line:

```bash
python -m google.adk.cli run --agent your_module.your_agent
```

## Choosing a Deployment Strategy

When deciding how to deploy your agent, consider the following factors:

### 1. Scale and Performance

- **Expected traffic**: How many concurrent users will interact with your agent?
- **Response time requirements**: Do you need low-latency responses?
- **Compute and memory needs**: Does your agent require significant resources?

### 2. Infrastructure Requirements

- **Integration needs**: Does your agent need to integrate with other systems?
- **Security requirements**: What are your authentication and data security needs?
- **Compliance**: Do you have specific regulatory requirements?

### 3. Operational Considerations

- **Monitoring and logging**: How will you track your agent's performance?
- **CI/CD pipeline**: How will you deploy updates?
- **Cost considerations**: What is your budget for hosting and operations?

## Deployment Process Overview

Regardless of your chosen deployment method, the general process follows these steps:

1. **Package your agent**: Prepare your agent code and dependencies for deployment.
2. **Configure environment**: Set up environment variables, authentication, and other configuration.
3. **Deploy**: Use the appropriate method to deploy your agent to the target environment.
4. **Verify**: Test that your deployed agent works as expected.
5. **Monitor**: Set up monitoring and logging to track your agent's performance.

## Packaging Your Agent

Before deploying, you need to package your agent code and dependencies:

### 1. Dependencies Management

Create a `requirements.txt` file to specify your project dependencies:

```
google-adk==0.1.0
requests==2.28.2
python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a configuration file or use environment variables for settings:

```python
# config.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load .env file if it exists
load_dotenv()

# Configuration
API_KEY = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
ENVIRONMENT = os.environ.get("ENVIRONMENT", "development")
DEBUG = os.environ.get("DEBUG", "False").lower() == "true"
```

### 3. Application Entry Point

Create a main application file that initializes and runs your agent:

```python
# app.py
from google.adk.server import create_server
from your_agent_module import your_agent
import config

# Create a server application
app = create_server(your_agent)

# This file can be used by different deployment methods
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # For local development
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080, debug=config.DEBUG)
```

## Deployment Security Considerations

When deploying your agent, consider these security best practices:

1. **API Keys and Credentials**: Never include API keys or credentials in your code. Use environment variables or secret management services.

2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your agent.

3. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.

4. **Authentication**: Add authentication to your agent's API to control access.

5. **Data Privacy**: Be careful about what data your agent logs or stores.

## Next Steps

The following sections provide detailed instructions for deploying your agent to specific environments:
