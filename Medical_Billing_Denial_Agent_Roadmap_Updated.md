# Medical Billing Denial Agent: Implementation Roadmap

## Implementation Instructions

  
**IMPORTANT: Follow these guidelines for the implementation process:**

  
1. **Implementation Order**: Epics should be implemented in sequential order (Epic 1, Epic 2, etc.) as each builds upon the foundation of previous epics.

  
2. **User Story Completion**:
- Implement each user story within an epic along with its relevant tests
- Run and verify all tests to ensure proper functionality
- List all completed tests under the user story in a "Tests Created" section
- Mark completed stories with a checkmark emoji (✅) at the beginning of the user story title
- Completed stories will be documented with the checkmark emoji

  
3. **Epic Completion**:
- An epic is considered complete only when ALL user stories within it are completed
- Mark completed epics with a checkmark emoji (✅) at the beginning of the epic title
- Completed epics will be shown in green in the flowchart diagram

  
4. **Progress Tracking**:
- Use the checkmarks and color coding in the flowchart as visual indicators of implementation progress
- Green indicates completed epics, blue indicates active epics, and gray indicates pending epics
- Reference the tests listed under each story to verify completion
- Maintain this documentation as an up-to-date record of implementation status
