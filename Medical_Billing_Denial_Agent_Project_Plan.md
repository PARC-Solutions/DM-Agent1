# Medical Billing Denial Agent: Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Objective
Develop a medical billing denial agent using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) that can process denial information, analyze causes, and provide actionable remediation steps to healthcare billing staff.

### 1.2 Success Criteria
- Agent accepts and processes claim denial context (CMS-1500 forms, EOBs, denial codes)
- Accurately identifies denial reasons based on CARC-RARC codes
- Provides clear, actionable steps for denial resolution
- Maintains conversational capabilities for follow-up questions
- Adheres to HIPAA compliance requirements
- Functions as an effective MVP for future expansion

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Multi-Agent System Design

```

### 2.2 Core Components

**Main Denial Assistant Agent (Coordinator)**
- Primary user interface handling conversation flow
- Routes specialized tasks to sub-agents
- Maintains session context and manages conversation history

**Specialized Agents:**
- **Denial Classifier Agent**: Categorizes denial types based on codes
- **Claims Analyzer Agent**: Extracts information from claim documents
- **Remediation Advisor Agent**: Generates actionable resolution steps

**Knowledge and Memory Components:**
- Vector-based knowledge stores for medical billing reference data
- Session-based memory for conversation continuity
- Artifact storage for temporary document handling

## 3. Technical Implementation
